            <p>giftee, Inc. launched first overseas project, an eTicket campaign for 122-branch chain of Japanese restaurants in Malaysia, reaching 360,000 customers</p>
            <p>eGift service(*1) provider, giftee, Inc. (Head office: Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo; Representative CEO: Mutsumi Ota) provided its eGift sales system for business, “eGift System” (*2) to Sushi King, a chain of Japanese restaurants operated in Malaysia by Sushi Kin Sdn Bhd (Head office: Malaysia; President & COO: Akihiko Hijioka). Under this arrangement, an eTicket campaign was running from May
16 to June 7, 2018 at Sushi King’s 122 stores (excluding Borneo Island). This was the first time that giftee, Inc. provided its eGift System, which works with the giftee Stamp(*3), to a business overseas.</p>
            <p>giftee, Inc. has its corporate mission “Using gifts to connect people to people, people to business, and people to communities.” Based on this mission, it provides “giftee”(*4), a casual gift service that allows customers to send gifts online easily, along with the sentiment of “a little thank you” for everyday kindnesses. It also operates a SaaS business providing the “eGift System,” an eGift sales system for businesses. Launching “giftee for Business,” a new solution for businesses based on its original “giftee” service, in April, 2016, and “Welcome!STAMP,” a local e-currency system, in May 2016, the company is using the technologies it has built up in its eGift business to actively develop new businesses.</p>
            <p>The Sushi King eGift campaign, SYOK-ING FIESTA (“Festival of Surprises” in Malay) was part of a BtoC program targeting Sushi King’s approximately 360,000 Member Card members that was running from May 16, the eve of Ramadan (May 17 – June 14 this year), to June 7, 2018. Conveyor belt sushi at Sushi King’s restaurants is usually offered at six different prices (RM 2.12 / 3.18 / 4.24 / 5.30 / 6.36 / 7.42 including tax), but during the campaign, items in the four higher-priced categories also were available for a standard price of RM3.18. Member Card members were sent eTickets for this campaign to their smartphones via SMS or Facebook Messenger before the campaign starts. When they received their eTickets, members could present it at any of Sushi King’s 122 stores (excluding Borneo) and had the eTicket validated by the store with a giftee STAMP. Once their eTickets had been validated, members could take advantage of the campaign offer. Each eTicket had a unique code, so when it was validated with the giftee STAMP, the data connected to the existing database, such as the customer’s attributes, the store they visited and what time they visited, could be collected immediately. This enabled the quantitative analysis of the campaign outcomes, which also made it useful as a CRM tool. Further, unlike paper tickets and coupons, as soon as the eTicket was validated with the giftee STAMP, it was “redeemed,” so the same eTicket couldn’t be re-used.</p>
            <p>Starting with this project, giftee, Inc. is working on the popularization of its eGIFT System in the ASEAN region, with a focus on Malaysia. It plans to introduce the system to around five brands in that country in 2018. It will also extend its CtoC eGift services overseas in its goal to create a custom and culture of casual gift-giving as a way of conveying one’s everyday feelings, by popularizing eGifts both in Japan and the rest of the world.</p>
            <p>(*1) eGIFT Service is a service in which the gift-giver purchases a digital gift ticket online and sends it to the recipient, who can exchange it for goods at the store.<br>
              (*2) eGIFT System is a gift sales system provided by giftee, Inc. to businesses. Businesses that introduce eGIFT System can operate their own eGift services on their own websites.<br>
              (*3) giftee STAMP, launched by giftee, Inc. on November 27, 2015, is a highly secure, battery-less electronic stamp. Simply by touching the electronic stamp to the screen of the smartphone or other mobile device, the electronic stamp can be checked against individual eGifts and be processed as spent.<br>
              (*4) giftee is a web-based service for the sale of eGifts, operated by giftee, Inc.</p>
