            <p>Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia -3rd March 2020- giftee,Inc & GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD. are pleased to announce the successful implementation of “eGift System” (*1), a sales system for eGifts, for llaollao, a frozen yogurt brand from Spain operated by Petra Empire Sdn. Bhd. (Headquarters: Malaysia / Executive Director: Tan Kai Young). From 3rd March 2020, the eGift service will be available in all 43 llaollao outlets in Malaysia. With the inclusion of llaollao, the total number of eGift brands available in Malaysia have reached 4 brands.</p>
            <p>The corporate mission of giftee, Inc. is “Using gifts to connect people & people, people & business, and people & communities.” Based on this mission, the company provides “giftee”(*2), a casual gift service that allows customers to send gifts online easily, along with “a little thank you” for everyday kindness. It also operates a SaaS business platform providing the “eGift System”, an eGift sales system for businesses. Utilizing the technologies built for the eGift business, the company had continued to actively develop new business solutions. This resulted in the launching of “giftee for Business”(*3) in April 2016, a new solution based on the original “giftee” service, and “Welcome! STAMP”, a local e-currency system launched in May 2016. Additionally, in October 2018, giftee, Inc. established GIFTEE MALAYSIA, a Malaysian subsidiary, and started to expand its eGift business in ASEAN countries.The eGift System to be introduced at llaollao is a system in which eGifts can be issued and “reconciled” instantly. eGifts can be purchased from the online sales webpage of the brand’s website, at which point the purchased eGift will be issued. The purchaser can choose to pay via credit card, online banking and also e-wallet for the eGift. The purchaser can then immediately send the issued eGift to a friend or family member via SMS, Whatsapp, or other similar apps. The eGift recipient can redeem the eGift for the item at a participating store by showing the eGift receipt screen on their smartphone. The store completes the payment process by scanning the eGift screen using its PoS system or the giftee Stamp system(*5).Each eGift has its own unique URL, which enables the instant collection of data, such as the date and time of the visit to the store, the visited store, the type of eGift, and whether or not other items are sold at the same time, as soon as the payment is processed. This information can then be used to conduct quantitative analysis of eGift usage, making the system a useful CRM tool. Also, unlike paper-based tickets and coupons, the eGift is “reconciled” the instant it is processed with the PoS system or giftee Stamp system, changing the status of the eGift to “Redeemed” so that the re-use of eGift can be prevented.</p>
            <p>Other than the sales of eGifts in the C-to-C market space for llaollao, it is also possible to run corporate digital campaigns in the form of incentive programs through GIFTEE MALAYSIA, in the B-to-C space of sales and distribution.</p>
            <p>giftee and GIFTEE MALAYSIA shall continue to introduce “eGift System” to Malaysian brands and promote eGifting as well as distribution to F&B brands. We hope to generate more demand for corporate customers in line with the C-to-C market development and work towards increasing the eGift distribution volume and building more awareness of eGift.
We aim to create a culture and custom of casual gifting by sending eGifts with ease, as a means to convey our day-to-day wishes to each other.</p>
            <p>(*1) eGift Plaftform provides end-to-end service from eGift issuance to distribution.<br>
              (*2) giftee is a web-based/application service for the sale of eGifts, operated by giftee, Inc.<br>
              (*3) giftee for Business enables companies to send eGifts to customers, for example as campaign gifts or as a reward for completing a survey.<br>
              (*4) eGift System is a gift sales system provided by giftee, Inc. to businesses. Businesses that implement the system can use it to operate eGift services on their own websites.</p>
