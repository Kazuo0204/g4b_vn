            <p>The corporate mission of giftee, Inc is “Using gifts to connect people & people, people & business, and people & communities”. Based on this mission, the company provides an end-to-end eGift platform(※1) solution from the issuance of eGifts to distribution, developing the business within and beyond Japan.There are 4 main services, namely “giftee”(※2), a casual gift service; “eGift System”, a system that generates and sells eGifts and tickets; “giftee for Business”(※3), a business-to-business eGift service; and “Welcome ! STAMP”, a platform for area revitalization. These eGift services provide extensive coverage to the individual customer, corporation and municipal council. Additionally, the eGift business expanded into the ASEAN region with the incorporation of GIFTEE MALAYSIA in October 2018, and has implemented the “eGift System” (※4) to 11 brands in Malaysia as of June 2020.</p>

            <p>Melissa Sim, CEO and co-founder of AdEasy said, “The funds and partnership with giftee Inc will help us scale faster, especially as we enter a time where brands are now looking to expand and grow their businesses post-COVID-19. With expertise from the Giftee team and a ready business community in Malaysia, we are confident that AdEasy will continue to grow aggressively.”</p>
            <p>The funds will also be utilised in enhancing the AdEasy platform and continuing the implementation of advanced tracking and measurement for advertisers.</p>
