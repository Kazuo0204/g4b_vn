            <p>GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD., a local subsidiary of the eGift service(*1) provider giftee, Inc. (Headquarters: Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo/Representative CEO: Mutsumi Ota), hereby announces that it will extend its business-oriented eGift sales system “eGift System” to Tealive, a lifestyle tea brand operated by LOOB Holding Sdn Bhd. (Headquarters: Malaysia/CEO: Bryan Loo), and from March 6, 2019, will begin sales of eGifts compatible with Tealive services at more than 200 outlets(excluding AEON Delica and MaxValu outlets) in Malaysia. This project will be giftee, Inc.’s first to provide eGift System to local companies in Malaysia.</p>
            <p>giftee, Inc. has the corporate mission of “Using gifts to connect people to people, people to business, and people to communities.” Based on this mission, it provides “giftee” (*2), a casual gift service that allows customers to send gifts online easily, along with the sentiment of “a little thank you” for everyday kindnesses. It also operates a SaaS business providing the “eGift System,”(*3) an eGift sales system for businesses. Launching “giftee for Business,” a new solution for businesses based on its original “giftee” service, in April 2016, and “Welcome! STAMP,” a local e-currency system, in May 2016, the company has used the technologies it has built up in its eGift business to actively develop new businesses. Additionally, in October 2018, giftee, Inc. established GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD., a Malaysian local subsidiary, and started to expand its eGift business in ASEAN countries.</p>
            <p>The “eGift System” service being introduced to Tealive will allow for immediate issue and validation of eGifts. eGifts can be purchased from online purchase portals for various brands, and are issued at the time of purchase. The purchaser can then give the eGifts they have purchased to friends, family and so on via SMS, WhatsApp, and other services, allowing for instant gifting with a personalized greeting. Having received an eGift unique link, the recipient clicks on it to reveal an eGift ticket, to be flashed from their smartphone at Tealive counters to redeem their drinks. eGift System links to PoS and other systems, allowing cashiers to scan the voucher to allow instant redemption. Each eGift has a unique URL, and when the eGift is validated, data such as the date/time of the store visit, name of the store visited, type of eGift, and details of any bundled selling can be instantly collected, providing versatile CRM tools that can be used for quantitative analysis of eGift usage information. Additionally, unlike tickets or coupons issued on paper, etc., eGifts are validated at the moment of processing via PoS or other systems, setting their status to “used” and thereby preventing repeat use of the corresponding ticket.</p>
            <p>Tealive brand operated by LOOB Holding Sdn Bhd., which will implement eGift System, is the leading lifestyle tea brand in Malaysia which serves over 70 varieties of drinks in more than 200 outlets in Malaysia. Malaysians can now purchase a Tealive eGift online for their family and friends, from “Tealive eGift” website (https://tealive.store.egift.asia), launched on March 6, 2019. There are three types of Tealive eGifts available: “RM6.5 Tealive Drink Voucher”, “RM7.5 Tealive Black Diamond Milk Tea Voucher “ and “RM10 Tealive Cash Voucher”.These eGifts are redeemable at all Tealive outlets in Malaysia except Tealive in AEON Delica and MaxValu outlets.</p>
